## üÜï Introducing: NFT Transfer Feature

#### What is NFT Transfer?

The `transfer_nft` function allows users to securely transfer ownership of an NFT to another address. Whether gifting an NFT or moving it between wallets, this feature eliminates the need for a sale process.

#### How NFT Transfer Works

1. **Verify Ownership**: Ensure the caller is the current owner of the NFT.
2. **Check for Transfer to Same Owner**: Prevent the transfer if the recipient is the current owner.
3. **Update Ownership**: Transfer ownership to the specified new address.
4. **Reset Sale Status**: Automatically reset the sale status and price of the NFT, so it‚Äôs no longer listed for sale after the transfer.

---

## üìú NFT Transfer Code in `NFTMarketplace.move`

```move
public entry fun transfer_nft(
    account: &signer,
    marketplace_addr: address,
    nft_id: u64,
    new_owner: address
) acquires Marketplace {
    let marketplace = borrow_global_mut<Marketplace>(marketplace_addr);
    let nft_ref = vector::borrow_mut(&mut marketplace.nfts, nft_id);

    // Ensure the caller is the owner of the NFT
    assert!(nft_ref.owner == signer::address_of(account), 300);

    // Prevent transfer to the same owner
    assert!(nft_ref.owner != new_owner, 301);

    // Update NFT ownership and reset sale status and price
    nft_ref.owner = new_owner;
    nft_ref.for_sale = false;
    nft_ref.price = 0;
}
```

### Function Logic

1. **Borrowing the Marketplace Resource**:

   ```move
   let marketplace = borrow_global_mut<Marketplace>(marketplace_addr);
   ```

   Accesses the `Marketplace` resource located at `marketplace_addr` to modify its data.

2. **Accessing the NFT**:

   ```move
   let nft_ref = vector::borrow_mut(&mut marketplace.nfts, nft_id);
   ```

   Retrieves a mutable reference to the NFT in the marketplace.

3. **Ensuring the Caller is the Owner**:

   ```move
   assert!(nft_ref.owner == signer::address_of(account), 300);
   ```

   Validates that the caller owns the NFT.

4. **Preventing Transfer to the Same Owner**:

   ```move
   assert!(nft_ref.owner != new_owner, 301);
   ```

   Ensures the recipient address is not the same as the current owner.

5. **Updating NFT Ownership and Sale Status**:
   ```move
   nft_ref.owner = new_owner;
   nft_ref.for_sale = false;
   nft_ref.price = 0;
   ```
   Updates the ownership, sale status, and price of the NFT.

## üîë MarketView: The Transfer Process in TypeScript

### Code Implementation in `MarketView.tsx`

```typescript
const handleTransferClick = (nft: NFT) => {
  setSelectedNft(nft);
  setIsTransferModalVisible(true);
};

const handleCancelTransfer = () => {
  setIsTransferModalVisible(false);
  setSelectedNft(null);
  setRecipientAddress(""); // Clear the recipient address
};

const handleConfirmTransfer = async () => {
  if (!selectedNft || !recipientAddress) return;

  try {
    const entryFunctionPayload = {
      type: "entry_function_payload",
      function: `${marketplaceAddr}::NFTMarketplace::transfer_nft`,
      type_arguments: [],
      arguments: [
        marketplaceAddr, // Marketplace address
        selectedNft.id.toString(), // NFT ID
        recipientAddress, // New owner's address
      ],
      data: {}, // Add this line to include the data property
    };

    const response = await (window as any).aptos.signAndSubmitTransaction(
      entryFunctionPayload
    );
    await client.waitForTransaction(response.hash);

    message.success("NFT transferred successfully!");
    setIsTransferModalVisible(false);
    handleFetchNfts(rarity === "all" ? undefined : rarity); // Refresh NFT list
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error transferring NFT:", error);
    message.error("Failed to transfer NFT.");
  }
};
```

### **1. `handleTransferClick`**

Triggered when the user clicks to transfer an NFT.

```typescript
const handleTransferClick = (nft: NFT) => {
  setSelectedNft(nft);
  setIsTransferModalVisible(true);
};
```

- **Purpose**: Sets the selected NFT for transfer and displays the transfer modal.
- **Parameters**:
  - `nft`: The NFT object selected for transfer.

---

### **2. `handleCancelTransfer`**

Handles the cancellation of the transfer process.

```typescript
const handleCancelTransfer = () => {
  setIsTransferModalVisible(false);
  setSelectedNft(null);
  setRecipientAddress("");
};
```

- **Purpose**: Resets the transfer process by hiding the modal, clearing the selected NFT, and resetting the recipient address.

---

### **3. `handleConfirmTransfer`**

Executes the actual transfer of the NFT on the blockchain.

#### **Steps**

#### **1. Initial Validation**

```typescript
if (!selectedNft || !recipientAddress) return;
```

- **Purpose**: Ensures that:
  - An NFT has been selected (`selectedNft` is not null).
  - A valid recipient address (`recipientAddress`) is provided.
- **Action**: If either condition fails, the function exits early without executing further.

---

#### **2. Constructing the Transaction Payload**

```typescript
const entryFunctionPayload = {
  type: "entry_function_payload",
  function: `${marketplaceAddr}::NFTMarketplace::transfer_nft`,
  type_arguments: [],
  arguments: [marketplaceAddr, selectedNft.id.toString(), recipientAddress],
};
```

- **`type`**: Specifies the payload type, which is "entry_function_payload".
- **`function`**: The fully qualified name of the Move function to execute. It includes:
  - `marketplaceAddr`: The blockchain address of the deployed NFT Marketplace.
  - `transfer_nft`: The specific function to call.
- **`type_arguments`**: An empty array since this function doesn't use generic type parameters.
- **`arguments`**: A list of parameters required by the Move function:
  1. `marketplaceAddr`: The address of the NFT Marketplace contract.
  2. `selectedNft.id.toString()`: The ID of the NFT being transferred, converted to a string.
  3. `recipientAddress`: The blockchain address of the new owner.

---

#### **3. Submitting the Transaction**

```typescript
const response = await(window as any).aptos.signAndSubmitTransaction(
  entryFunctionPayload
);
```

- **Purpose**: Sends the transaction payload to the Aptos blockchain using the Aptos wallet adapter.
- **`signAndSubmitTransaction`**:
  - Prompts the connected wallet (e.g., Petra) to sign the transaction.
  - Submits the signed transaction to the blockchain.
- **Response**: Contains details about the submitted transaction, including a unique transaction hash.

---

#### **4. Waiting for Confirmation**

```typescript
await client.waitForTransaction(response.hash);
```

- **Purpose**: Waits for the blockchain to confirm the transaction.
- **`response.hash`**: The unique hash of the transaction used to track its status.

---

#### **5. Success Feedback**

```typescript
message.success("NFT transferred successfully!");
setIsTransferModalVisible(false);
handleFetchNfts(rarity === "all" ? undefined : rarity);
```

- **`message.success`**: Displays a success notification to the user.
- **`setIsTransferModalVisible(false)`**: Closes the transfer modal.
- **`handleFetchNfts`**: Refreshes the NFT list:
  - If `rarity` is "all", it fetches all NFTs.
  - Otherwise, it filters the list by the specified rarity.

---

#### **6. Error Handling**

```typescript
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error transferring NFT:", error);
  message.error("Failed to transfer NFT.");
}
```

- **`catch (error)`**: Captures any errors that occur during the transaction process.
- **Logging**: Outputs the error details to the console for debugging.
- **User Feedback**: Displays an error notification.

---
